       <p>Welcome to this joint effort of a Chess Game App. This Program was orginally built by EmptyFlame. I took what was in that repo and added Chess 960! Both Chess games don't have a win function or a way for others peices to be converted to different peices but it is almost a finished Chess Game App. </p>
